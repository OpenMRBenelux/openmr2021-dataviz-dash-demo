# Interactive visualization with Python, Plotly and Dash

This repository contains the content of the "Interactive visualization with Python, Plotly and Dash" demo presented at the [OpenMR Virtual 2021](https://openmrbenelux.github.io/) event:

> The tools are out there for researchers to publish their data and results in rich online formats that offer accessibility, interaction and exploration. Yet, we still see a majority of standard plots and images in PDF format. In this demo, we will explore the possibilities offered by Python, Plotly and Dash to make your research outputs interactive and future-aware!

## Access

You can access the computational environment directly in your browser in order to run through the examples yourself:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/OpenMRBenelux/openmr2021-dataviz-dash-demo/HEAD)

So there's no need to install Python or any of the packages. Try it out!

## Content

The demo follows [this presentation](https://tinyurl.com/openmr-dash-demo).

Throughout the first part of the demo, examples will be shown from the Jupyter notebook that is available in the above mentioned computational environment. After launching the Binder instance by clicking on the button above, you can navigate to the `code` directory and open the notebook titled `openmr2021-dataviz-dash-demo.ipynb`.

After examples of interactive Plotly charts are shown via the Jupyter notebook (and some external examples), a second part of the demo will be dedicated to an example of a Dash application accompanying a scientific research article: [https://rt-me-fmri.herokuapp.com/](https://rt-me-fmri.herokuapp.com/).

In the last part of the demo, you will be taken through the steps of how to develop and deploy a Dash app using free and open source resources.
